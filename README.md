## Hello 🙋🏻‍♀️
I am [Aakansha Dalmia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aakanshadalmia/), a Computer Science Engineer looking to shift gears into a more research oriented career path. I am fascinated by the world of Artificial Intelligence _(who isn’t?!)_ and deeply enthralled by Responsible AI. We are living in an era where AI is everywhere, and we use it to make most of our day-to-day decisions. As such, it becomes very important that these "AI models" are at the very least - safe, fair, and free from bias. This is precisely what Responsible AI takes care of and what makes up my focal interest.

## Skills
**Areas of Expertise:** Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Recommendation System, Computer Vision
**Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Streamlit, Vertex AI, PostgreSQL, Docker, SPSS, Minitab <br>
**Languages:** Python, SQL, MATLAB


## Reading Lists
Books have always been my best friend and my love for reading and discovering new ideas is perhaps what first sparked my interest in research. In an ideal world, I would never want to forget the secrets learnt from any piece that I have ever picked up and read. To aid my memory, here are some lists I have curated of late - includes both things I want to read and have already read.
