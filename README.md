## Hello 🙋🏻‍♀️
I am [Aakansha Dalmia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aakanshadalmia/), a Computer Science Engineer looking to shift gears into a more research oriented career path. I am fascinated by the world of Artificial Intelligence _(who isn’t?!)_ and deeply enthralled by Responsible AI. We are living in an era where AI is everywhere, and we use it to make most of our day-to-day decisions. As such, it becomes very important that these "AI models" are at the very least - safe, fair, and free from bias. This is precisely what Responsible AI takes care of and what makes up my focal interest.

## Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, MATLAB
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Streamlit, Vertex AI, PostgreSQL, Docker, SPSS, Minitab
- **Areas of Expertise:** Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Recommendation System, Computer Vision

## Reading Lists
Books have always been my best friend and my love for reading and discovering new ideas is perhaps what sparked research. In an ideal world, I would never want to forget the secrets learnt from any piece that I have ever picked up and read. Having lived in the real world though - I understood that wasn't possible and so here are some lists I have curated of late - includes both things I want to read and have already read.
